## V-Tracker

## Project Description
  V-Tracker is a comprehensive web application designed for vehicle owners to effortlessly
log and track essential vehicle data, including maintenance, repairs, 
fuel usage, vehicle details, and insurance information.

  The purpose of the app is to help users stay organized and proactive in managing
their vehicle's health by keeping a clear record of tasks such as oil changes, 
transmission fluid replacements, brake pad changes, and other routine or major repairs.

  All entries are conveniently saved on a dedicated Log page, with automatic backups to a Google Spreadsheet for additional 
security and accessibility. The app also features visual charts to help users track progress, 
monitor trends, and stay on top of upcoming maintenance needs, ensuring vehicles run smoothly and efficiently.
